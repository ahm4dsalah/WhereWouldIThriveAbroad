# Where Would I Thrive Abroad
This is a data science project that explores global expatriate success factors to find countries that are most aligned with my personal priorities.

---

## Project Proposal

As an international student that is planning to move abroad, I'd like to make an informed decision about which countries would fit best for my lifestyle, and goals.  
This project will explore what factors influence expatriate success and happiness - such as cost of living, career opportunities, social structures, integration - and compare them with my own preferences and priorities.

The goal is to obtain a list of countries that are most aligned with my priorities to focus my considerations and plans.

## Data to Be Used

The project will include both country-level data and personal preference data.

**Public data types expected on :**
- Economic data (eg., career opportunities, cost of living)
- Social data (eg., integration, social support, language barrier)
- Well-being data (eg., happiness score, quality of life)

**Personal data:**
- My self-assessment ratings and preferences represented in a way that assigns more importance to specific conditions.
