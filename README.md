# Where Would I Thrive Abroad

---

## Project Proposal

This project will explore what factors influence expatriate success and happiness - such as GDP, health, social structures. Using real-world datasets of country economic and social metrics, this project will investigate how those metrics influence happiness in both domestic and foreign-born country residents.

"Is the happiness of foreign country residents influenced the same way as domestic residents?". To answer this, we will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover initial patterns and correlations, followed by Hypothesis testing to determine if the influence of the like GDP differs between the domestic and foreign-born population. Finally, we will apply Machine Learning techniques to build a predictive model that calculates the degree to which those factors contribute to the happiness of the domestic and foreign-born population.

## Motivation

As an international student who wants to work abroad, I would like to make an informed decision by moving beyond simple job placement and economic metrics to prioritize long-term well-being and happiness.

## Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant difference between the influence of country metrics on the happiness of the domestic population and the influence of those same metrics on the foreign-born population.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The influence of country metrics on the happiness of the foreign-born population is significantly different from the influence of those metrics on the domestic population.
